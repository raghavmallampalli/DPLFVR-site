The novel contributions of our paper are as follows:
1. We propose an algorithm for the distillation of dark knowledge from the stereo dataset as a supervisor. This enables our network to implicitly extract depth information from the dual pixel data and utilize it to create better reconstructions.
2. We open source our dataset of dual pixel videos with 3 views, the first of its kind.
3. We use vision transformers for the first time in the light field reconstruction domain, enabling zero-shot cross domain knowledge transfer.
